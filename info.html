      <h3>What is Alzheimer's</h3>
    </div>
      <p> Alzheimer's is a disease that causes loss of memoery and cognative ability. It is a subset of dementia, and is fatal. There is no current cure because the causes are unknown and different for each person. This terminal illness has three stages: early,middle,and late. Early-stage alzheimer's starts with loss of short term memory and trouble finding words. Middle-stage starts with moodyness and trouble identifying surrondings. Late stages start with loss of congnative abilities and awareness and eventually end in death. This disease in known to be brutal not only for the patient but also for their families. We wanted to bring awareness to the issue in an impactful way, but we also wanted to leave the possibility of hope. Although, a cure is no where near ready, we want to inspire people to help research the disease and build awareness.  </p>
